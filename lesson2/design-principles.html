                <p>Whitespace is the negative or unmarked space in a design. It is the space between the layouts, lines and user interface (UI) elements on a page. The name might make you think that whitespace must be empty, but that is not the case, as it could be any color, texture or image.</p>
                <p>The Progressive Punctuation website is an excellent example of whitespace. The empty space around the items on the site focuses your attention to the content. As a result of  focusing your attention, the message and purpose of the site is communicated clearly and succinctly.</p>
                <p>As a side note, who doesn't appreciate the use of an interrobang, doubt or snark mark?</p>

                <h2 class="subheader">Contrast</h2>
                <p><a href="http://www.baesman.com/">Baesman</a></p>
                <img src="/lesson2/images/baesman.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Baesman's website, blue square with green square with inlaid text" class="column-image">
                <p>Contrast is defined as <em>"the state of being strikingly different from something else in juxtaposition or close association."</em> In the design world, contrast is used to create a design based on differences.</p>
                <p>The Baesman Insights & Marketing website is an good example of contrast in two ways. First and foremost, you've got the blue and green blocks. These create a division between the upper and lower half of the webpage. your eye is immediately drawn to this difference. This use of contrast also creates a good balance between the upper and lower halves, which keeps your eye on the page.</p>
                <p>The second way contrast is used on this page is through the use of white text on a colored background. This negative space creates contrast from complex background, leading your eye to focus on and read the text. By using the difference in complexity, the website is able to communicate it's message of statistic driven marketing.</p>

                <h2 class="subheader">Fitt's Law</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></p>
                <img src="/lesson2/images/apple.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Apple's website showing an iPad" class="column-image">
                <p>Fitt's Law states that the amount of time required to move a pointer to a certain area (such as a button), is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. In plain English, that means the further the cursor has to move and the smaller the button or destination, the longer it will take.</p>
                <p>Apple.com is an excellent example of this principle of having larger interactive elements. Many of the pictures are links to the items they show. In addition to that, the "Learn More" links and the navigation elements are appropriately sized for your screen. In addition to that, the elements are clearly defined, which elimiates confusion as to the function of the button or link. </p>
